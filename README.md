#All-In-Mentoring

Idea: We are building an application that will allow volunteers, parents, youths, and mentors to learn more about the All In Mentoring Program. Additionally, volunteers will be able to sign up for events on the calendar page. Parents will be able to access necessary documents for their childrenâ€™s participation in the program. Users will be able to view mentor bios and general information about All In Mentoring. Admins of All In Mentoring will be able to schedule events that are visible on the calendar. 

Target Audience: Parents, mentors, volunteers, and children of the All In Mentoring program in South Seattle.

Problem: All In Mentoring needs a website that shares information about their business and manages their events. 

Goal: Our goal is to provide a modern UI with all the specifications provided by our client, including an intuitive google calendar that is easily integrated and managed by our Admins. 

Nice to Haves: A donate button that routes user to a PayPal account. 

User Stories: Home page, calendar page (users can email Heidi and Lavell, who have permissions to update the calendar) , mentor page (5 mentor profiles), parent page (where parents will be able to access PDF links for permissions slips/waivers, code of conduct).
